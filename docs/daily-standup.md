# Daily Stand-up for GlowVibe Project

## Overview
The Daily Stand-up is a short, focused meeting held every day of the Sprint. Its purpose is to keep the team synchronized and ensure everyone is aligned on their tasks, identify any blockers or challenges, and make sure the team is moving toward achieving the Sprint Goal.

### Participants
- **Scrum Master**: Facilitates the stand-up and ensures it stays on track.
- **Development Team**: All team members (Product Owner may attend occasionally but doesn’t need to speak).

## Structure of the Daily Stand-up

1. **Time-box**:  
   The Daily Stand-up is time-boxed to **15 minutes** and should be held at the same time each day. The team should stand during the meeting (hence the name) to keep it short and focused.

2. **Three Key Questions**:
   Each team member answers the following questions:
   - **What did I accomplish yesterday?**
   - **What am I working on today?**
   - **What obstacles or blockers am I facing?**
   
   The answers should be brief and to the point. Focus on progress, goals, and issues, not on detailed technical discussions.

3. **Blocker Discussion**:  
   If any team member mentions a blocker (something preventing them from progressing), the Scrum Master should address it right after the stand-up or schedule a separate meeting to resolve it. The stand-up should not devolve into problem-solving or discussions.

4. **Team Alignment**:  
   The stand-up should ensure that everyone is aligned with the Sprint Goal and moving in the right direction. It’s important for the Scrum Master to keep the team focused on achieving that goal.

## Best Practices
- **Be brief and focused**: Keep answers concise and avoid detailed technical discussions.
- **Stay on schedule**: Stick to the 15-minute time-box.
- **Don't use the stand-up for problem-solving**: If an issue arises, schedule a follow-up meeting to dive deeper into the problem.
- **Use a visual board**: If possible, use a Kanban board or task management tool (e.g., Jira, Trello) to visually track progress during the stand-up.
- **Stand up**: This helps keep the meeting short and focused.

## Tips for Effective Stand-ups
- Encourage all team members to speak directly and avoid unnecessary explanations.
- Focus on progress toward the Sprint Goal, not individual tasks.
- If an issue or blocker is raised, address it after the stand-up.
