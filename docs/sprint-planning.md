# Sprint Planning for GlowVibe Project

## Overview
Sprint Planning is a critical Scrum ceremony that takes place at the start of every Sprint. The purpose of Sprint Planning is to define the **Sprint Goal**, determine which items from the **Product Backlog** will be worked on, and establish a plan for completing those items during the Sprint.

### Participants
- **Product Owner**: Presents and clarifies the items in the Product Backlog.
- **Scrum Master**: Facilitates the meeting and ensures Scrum processes are followed.
- **Development Team**: Decides what work can be completed in the upcoming Sprint and discusses how to achieve the Sprint Goal.

## Steps in Sprint Planning

1. **Set the Sprint Goal**  
   The team and Product Owner discuss the overall objective of the Sprint. The goal should be achievable and measurable.

   **Example Sprint Goal**:  
   _“Implement the user registration and profile management features for the GlowVibe platform.”_

2. **Review the Product Backlog**  
   The Product Owner presents the top-priority items in the Product Backlog. The team may ask clarifying questions and provide input on the scope of each backlog item.

   **Example Backlog Items for Sprint**:  
   - User registration system
   - Profile management UI
   - Database schema for user data

3. **Select Items for the Sprint**  
   The Development Team commits to completing a set of backlog items during the Sprint. This process involves evaluating the capacity of the team and considering dependencies, blockers, or other constraints.

4. **Define the Sprint Backlog**  
   Once the items are selected, the team breaks down those items into smaller tasks and adds them to the **Sprint Backlog**. Each task should be specific, actionable, and well-defined.

   Example:
   - Task 1: Create database schema for user data
   - Task 2: Build user registration form
   - Task 3: Integrate front-end registration form with back-end API

5. **Estimate Tasks**  
   Using a suitable estimation technique (e.g., story points, hours, or T-shirt sizing), the team estimates the time or effort required to complete each task.

6. **Identify Dependencies & Risks**  
   The team discusses potential risks and dependencies that might impact the Sprint and plans accordingly.

7. **Finalize the Plan**  
   The team reviews the Sprint Backlog and ensures everyone is aligned on the work to be done, the Sprint Goal, and the expected timeline.

## Timebox
Sprint Planning is time-boxed, typically lasting **2 hours** for a 2-week Sprint (this can vary depending on the length of the Sprint).

---

## Example Output of Sprint Planning
- **Sprint Goal**: Complete the user registration and profile management features.
- **Sprint Backlog**:  
   - Create user database schema
   - Implement user registration API
   - Design user profile page UI
   - Integrate front-end registration form
   - Set up testing for registration functionality

## Tips for Effective Sprint Planning
- Ensure the Product Backlog items are well-defined and prioritized before the meeting.
- Keep the meeting focused on planning and avoid going into unnecessary technical details.
- Use your retrospective feedback to improve your Sprint Planning process for future Sprints.
